# Free Clash Subscriptions

This repository contains free subscription links for use with **Clash Meta client** or other Clash Meta kernel based proxy tools.

## Getting Started

Clash client is a GUI proxy manager that allows you to configure and manage various proxy types, such as V2Ray, Shadowsocks, and Trojan. These subscription links will help you import multiple proxy configurations quickly.

### How to Use

1. Download and install [Clash for Windows](https://github.com/Fndroid/clash_for_windows_pkg/releases).
2. Open Clash for Windows.
3. Navigate to the **Profiles** tab.
4. Click **"Import"** and paste the subscription URL.
5. Click **"Download"** to update the proxy list.
6. Select your preferred proxy under the **Proxies** tab and start surfing the web securely!

### Subscription Links

Here are some subscription links you can use:

| Name          | Type         | Subscription URL | Next update（utc+8) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |---------------- |
| Free SSR   | ShadowsocksR  | `https://example.com/ss`    | 2024-09-11 12:00|
| V2Ray Free    | V2Ray        | `TODO` | 2024-09-11 12:00|
| Trojan Global | Trojan       | `TODO`| 2024-09-11 12:00|
| Premium Proxy | Mixed        | `TODO` | 2024-09-11 12:00|

> ⚠️ **Note**: The above subscriptions **will be expired** and automatically updated **every 4 hours**.

### Configuration Rules

If you wish to bypass the proxy for certain websites or regions (e.g., for local services), you can add rules in the **Rules** tab in Clash for Windows. Example rules:
- **DOMAIN-SUFFIX,baidu.com,DIRECT**
- **DOMAIN-SUFFIX,taobao.com,DIRECT**

These rules ensure that traffic to specific domains bypasses the proxy.


## Important: Handling Expired Proxies

When a proxy stops working:
1. **Delete the old subscription** from your Clash client.
2. **Come back here** and **copy the new subscription** link.
3. Paste the new link into Clash and update your configuration.

This process ensures that you always have the latest working proxies.
